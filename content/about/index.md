I concept and designs books, web sites, catalogues, magazines, graphic identities, exhibitions, and other printed and digital forms of communication in the cultural and business fields. This work is often done in collaboration with a global network of photographers, illustrators, programmers, artists and writers.

As my practice develops, I engage projects of increasing complexity involving digital and print design, with a special focus on editorial and publication projects. I travel constantly, studying culture, urban environments, and global patterns of human interaction. Findings and insights from my travels are woven throughout my work.
